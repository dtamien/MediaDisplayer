# Description

I developed a media displayer specifically for my parents to use at their shop. They needed a way to showcase numerous ads on a screen, so I created this solution for them.

# Media side

Photos and videos are displayed in a loop. A photo stays on the screen for 10 seconds, and a video plays until its end before the next media is displayed.

# Information side

The current date and time, the current weather, and a QR code are displayed on the screen. The QR code links to the shop's social media Facebook page.
