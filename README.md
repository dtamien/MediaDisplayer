# Description

I developed a media displayer specifically for my parents to use at their shop. They needed a way to showcase numerous ads on a screen, so I created this solution for them.

# Media side

Photos and videos are displayed in a loop. A photo stays on the screen for 10 seconds, and a video plays until its end before the next media is displayed.

# Information side

The current date and time, information on the weather at the store's location and a QR code are displayed. The QR code links to the store's Facebook page.

# Commands

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt && yarn
```

## Run the python process

```bash
python3 process_media_directory.py \
    --src-dir /Users/damientanneau/Desktop/Ã€\ la\ diffusion \
    --dest-dir /Users/damientanneau/Documents/GITHUB/media-displayer/dist
```
